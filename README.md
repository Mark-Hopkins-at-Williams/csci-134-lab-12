The assignment description can be found 
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GCdsqGC-hD2w8_0F-Xu_C6J8-7qfnAawMlXEHOYqChY/edit?usp=sharing).

This repository contains several starter files for the code
you need to write for Lab 12:
- `breakout.py`: All of your code should go in this file.
- `config.py`: Contains information about how to configure a particular game of Breakout.
- `graphics.py`: This contains code for displaying the graphics. DO NOT CHANGE.

Ignore (but do not delete!!!) the other files in this repository.
