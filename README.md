CSCI 134 Lab 12 ("Breakout!")
-----------------------------

The assignment description can be found 
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GCdsqGC-hD2w8_0F-Xu_C6J8-7qfnAawMlXEHOYqChY/edit?usp=sharing).

This repository contains several starter files for the code
you need to write for Lab 12:
- `breakout.py`: Most (or all) of your code should go in this file.
- `config.py`: Contains information about how to configure a particular game of Breakout.
- `graphics.py`: This contains code for displaying the graphics.

There are also three versions of the game that can be run from a Terminal:
- `bunsen.py`: This is the "official" version of Breakout for this assignment.
- `simple.py`: A simple version of Breakout, useful for testing your code.
- `classic.py`: The classic arcade version of Breakout.

Ignore (but do not delete!!!) the other files in this repository.
